        <p> When reading this article, it was interesting to see the change and the demand for the internet over time. When the website was first created in 1989, it stood as a free place for anyone to learn and use to make their websites and try to get information out to anyone. It wasn't considered to go super far in its making, but now that almost all of the world depends on the web, as it is our main source of information and now businesses build off of its reach and spread. However, what happens when that free access comes under speculation? As the article reads on, it gives important insight for web developers and creators, which also should be made aware to web users. </p>

        <p> As mentioned in the articles, Google and Facebook came on the rise as big companies that revolutionized the space. They made it to where the web is constantly growing, even to where it became a space for more jobs and also the beginning of small business practices online. However, since this space is fairly new compared to other sources of media, it isn't as regulated to keep people safe and prevent bigger companies, like Google and Facebook, from taking advantage of this free system and taking it over. This means that despite the best intentions of the first creators of the webpage, now big companies are trying to control and use the space for their gain despite giving false promises to company followers.</p>
 
         <p>One of the main problems in this platform is that there is no real way currently to hold up the idea of accessibility and use to everyone. There is no restriction to the internet. Anyone can post and take whatever they please from the web, which can create good but also bad consequences for using the space. This includes spreading false information, creating hurtful biases, and trying to take advantage of freedom by trying to restrict it for one's gain. Of how the internet scene is now being formed by major companies, it is easy to see that they are trying to take as much of the web as possible to control it. Some restriction is necessary, as despite how big the company is, places like social media now can brew a place of misinformation and anger, leading other users to put others down based on their beliefs, identity, and ethnicity. It is an especially turbulent time, as currently in 2023, the COVID-19 pandemic is still running through countries, creating restriction, spite, and tension. Despite this, big web companies such as Facebook and Google, have tried to restrict information or create company-beneficial spaces to make the internet more accessible. For example, Facebook launched a program known as Free Basics, which allowed less fortunate countries to have access to the internet under Facebook. It would give them their news, health information, communication through the internet, and so on. This caused many countries to revolt against this due to this being heavily controlled and could feed biased information to the people. This concept was coined as "digital colonialism," which is using the information to control and input one's ideals to other countries. The issue has been going on past 2019, as companies continue to get and want more power. In the grand scheme of things such as other media like television, radio, and so on, there are rules in place for companies to not monopolize and take control of these spaces. The internet does not have this, creating a lot of loopholes for bigger companies to take advantage of. In recent years, this is seen with Google, Amazon, Facebook, and so on. It is important to know of these shortcomings and be aware as creators and consumers of what is intended behind the scenes to combat it and keep one's freedom.</p>
