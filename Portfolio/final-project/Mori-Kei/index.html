                <section class="Text_Background"> <p class="thin_pencil">Fashion has a way of finding interest in the public eye and gaining a following. Social media is a big contender for spreading new ideas and trends in the fashion industry, making influencers jump on the idea of creating a new trend or being the first to wear something off of the runway once readily available to those with the money for it. However, a majority of social media consumers are not these big billionaires and look to find a fashion trend that is their own and comfortable in. Those that find certain styles of clothing or pieces comfortable usually find themselves more attractive and confident. With this in mind, a piece of clothing can have these traits, but there is also the outside influence of social media that was mentioned.
                    Now in the 21st century, social media has an impact on consumers and consumer culture because there is a seeking of attention from their like peers. Whether it be positive or negative, the attention causes social media to shift its attention to what is catching the most attention along with being new. This is also included in the context of style and how it changes on the basis of social media and it helps spread things such as pieces tied to nostalgia, and new yet odd designs. This can be said in the rise of Harajuku fashion as a lot of art styles ties to the nostalgia of certain shows, have a tie of comfort to them, and have a bit of an odd look to them. As stated by a person that works on his style and is always open to something new, Finley Brisko says… 
                </p>
                 <p class="quotes">“[Pop Culture and entertainment] probably influence what people consider to be “attractive” or “stylish,” based on their perception of the media and the characters.”</p>
            
                <p class="thin_pencil">
                    What he is mentioning is the fact that in some shows, people get attached to characters that have a similar taste of style to them and would look for styles that the character and themselves would wear. Harajuku plays into this need and shamelessly gets inspired by looks that are popularized by shows and media, fulfilling that fantasy of dressing like your favorite character, favorite music artist, etc.
