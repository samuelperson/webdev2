It is a style that is full of vibrant color and mainly known for the candy charms bright on the face, clips in the hair, and jewelry that is mostly seen mostly among young children. Decora Kei is a style of fashion that is remeniscent of childhood, which is reflected by the bright colors and the toys and charms usually paired with the outfits of the models. This style was made a staple in 1995 by creative director and stylist Sebastian Masuda, creating a store called 6%DOKIDOKI. The styles were influenced by Tomoe Shinohara, who was a TV personality and singer at the time, was known for chilld-like clothing and personality. With her as inspriration, this styles seeks to encapsulate the fun and innocence of childhood, rreconnecting people to the purest times of life.</p></div>

            <div class="Text_Background"> <p class="thin_pencil">Harajuku and Tokyo street fashion is usually influenced by a lot of subjects that are in pop culture and popular media. A common influence is Anime, as many artists make their style dynamic and multipurpose for fashion. A common example is skater streetwear and graphic tees being used in emo/alt fashion. Harajuku and Tokyo street fashion is a very broad topic, as it is not just one fashion trend, but multiple different genres within the umbrella that is street fashion. Along with that, as much as many people think that these styles are common in the streets of Harajuku, there are few people that sport these looks once in a while due to the extreme look in some subgenres. For example, there is Lolita fashion which is influenced by maid styles found in anime and other media that accentuates a very feminine and formal style. There are people that dress in Lolita and are even considered Lolita models, but people only wear these clothes once in a while, and is not as common as expected. 
                Old media and culture staples like cartoons show their way into styles and usually get revamped or remixed into new style trends. There were trends in Tokyo that would follow this known as the Vintage remake style, which is using pieces that were from eras and styles of the past and resewing them to something new. This included pieces from the 80’s, 90’s, and so on. A lot of cartoons also echo the era that they come from. This is due to their aesthetic fitting the time era they were made in and pulling consumers due to the memory’s importance. The fashion industry looks for new consumers, and seeing the success of retro styles and callbacks to cartoons, they bank on nostalgia and use nostalgic icons so they could stick in consumers’ heads and bring them back to their brand to buy.  
                As consumers, we do not realize what an impact memory and influence have on us. Whether it be on reflecting on old fashion trends that make us remember a simpler time or a favorite influencer wearing this cool new design on a T-shirt, it is everywhere. The reach of influence also expands more due to social media’s reach as well. In reviewing the impact of style on other consumers, Morgan Lazlo brought up a recent point of this and how media and pop culture can affect fashion.

                 <p class="quotes">“People like being in style and in the know of what is trending. If a new style is on the rise or deemed cool, lots of people switch and start imitating that style and then quickly move on to the next new style. As different shows and characters get popular, the style of dress that the characters wear gets popular and becomes a part of the cycle of trends. For example, Stranger Things got really popular and there was a resurgence of the 80s style. Things popular in the 80s resurged again and the modern style was now influenced by that. This is not the only show, as lots of people base their style off of anime characters and TV show characters.”</p>

                Seeing from this observation, nostalgia and influence are big drivers for the creation of fashion and what makes something resurge and trend again. It does not have to be necessarily the cartoon character themselves, but also the characters' styles and what they wear. This influences styles like Lolita and other styles of Harajuku fashion, making the trends popular and interesting worldwide and not just in Japan.
