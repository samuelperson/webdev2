                <section class="Text_Background"> <p class="thin_pencil">Harajuku fashion has a lot of subgenres that embody a lot of aspects that are the backbone of many styles seen on the runway today around the world. Along with the runway, the influence of style sets the journey for the trends that will come to be. As previously mentioned, not everyone can afford runway or higher name brand clothing, so things that look similar and that fit everyday wear will catch people’s attention and be made popular. This is how Harajuku fashion gained popularity and spread many subgenres of fashion movements around the world. 
                Many people do not realize that maybe some of the clothing that they wear or reasons that certain trends come back into cycles from previous decades are because of Harajuku fashion. This can include trends such as the remaking of clothing from the 90s, using techno themes that were popular in sci-fi Tv shows, and movies from the 80s and 90s in styles such as Decora Kei, and punk rock styles stemming from 70s and 80s styles. Harajuku is a place that recycles and reuses old trends and brings them back in ways so everyone can partake in them. People find comfort in groups and fitting into something, so being able to find a community surrounded by clothing is another perk of Harajuku fashion. These clothes made accessible to others with lower incomes allow them to create a sense of community within the styles. When people walk down the street sporting said styles, those that share the same would most likely find familiarity with them and be able to tell by what they are wearing what they like and if they would be worth talking to. As mentioned by Alexis, she notices that,

                 <p class="quotes">“I think individuals seek to belong somewhere and at the same time be true to themselves. People look at what they like to consume in the media or entertainment to help influence their choices in appearance. For example, if a person loves anime they might choose to buy or make clothes and accessories related to anime to show their love for it, and as a result, this person is able to fit in with other people who share a love for anime while being themselves b/c he/she had the individual freedom to choose the clothes or style.” </p>
            
                <p class="thin_pencil">
                    This is what Harajuku fashion does for consumers. A lot of the city’s styles are very out there and niche, calling back to times that, at this point, many newer generations haven't lived through. Other subgenres of Harajuku also seem bizarre to other clothing due to vibrant colors, interesting silhouettes, and so on. Because of its uniqueness, those that are interested in a certain style create a community and sense of belonging that a lot of other branches of fashion do not include. Fashion is actually quite exclusive and shaming towards other people. Harajuku opens the fashion industry up to many other people and therefore makes the styles more popular and mainstream.
